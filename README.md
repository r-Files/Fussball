The aim of this project is to present simple methods of webscraping. The following example therefore uses a web page whose static content is to be analyzed. The goal is to convert all results of the German Bundesliga available on the website into a table with the following requirements:

* Date of match
* Name of home team (without spaces)
* Name of visiting team (without spaces)
* Final result

It is important to note that the table must not contain any missing values. Therefore, the game date for all games on the same day must be specified separately.

## Input 
![picture of the source webpage](pictures/target_webpage.png?raw=true "Input")


## Output
